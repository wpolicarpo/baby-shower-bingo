# Baby Shower Bingo

As time passes, our friends are raising their families and we need to help them with their baby shower organisation. This is my contribution to them...

## How to use

```bash
$ bingo $NUMBER_OF_CARDS
```

Where `$NUMBER_OF_CARDS` is the number of cards you want to generate.

`bingo 50` will generate `25` sheets with `2` cards side by side (landscape mode) each.
